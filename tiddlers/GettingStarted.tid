~ProjectManager is a simple [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] plugin for managing projects & todo lists, inspired by other tools such as [[Todoist|https://todoist.com]] and [[Basecamp|https://basecamp.com]].

I started this project as an experiment to see how good ~TiddlyWiki could be as a Web Application Platform. It turns out to be an extremely good foundation for building SPA.
